    <p style="text-align: left">
      I will be going over some movies that I've watched in the past few weeks.
      I'll be giving my opinion on how good or bad I thought the movie was and
      why. These movies are going to be recent releases and we'll see titles
      such as <cite> Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse</cite>,
      <cite>Elemental</cite>, and <cite>The Flash</cite>.<br />
